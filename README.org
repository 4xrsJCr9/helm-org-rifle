* helm-org-rifle.el

This is my rifle.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.  My rifle is my best friend. It is my life.  I must master it as I must master my life.

What does my rifle do?  It searches rapidly through my Org files, quickly bringing me the information I need to defeat the enemy.

This package is a continuation of the fantastic [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-search-goto][org-search-goto/org-search-goto-ml]] packages, now with Helm support. It searches both headings and contents of entries in Org buffers, and it displays entries that match all search terms, whether the terms appear in the heading, the contents, or both.  Matching portions of entries' contents are displayed with surrounding context and grouped by buffer to make it easy to acquire your target.

Entries are fontified by default to match the appearance of an Org buffer, and optionally the entire path can be displayed for each entry, rather than just its own heading.

* Installation

Install [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] and [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s]].  Then require this package in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'helm-org-rifle)
#+END_SRC

Then you can customize the =helm-org-rifle= group if you like.

* Usage

Run the command =helm-org-rifle=, type some words, and all current =org-mode= buffers will be rifled through, with results grouped by buffer.  Hit =RET= to show the selected entry.  You can also show the entry in an indirect buffer by selecting that action from the Helm actions list.

You can also type the name of an open Org buffer (usually the filename), and only results from that buffer will be displayed.

* Credits

+ This package is based on =org-search-goto= (specifically, =org-search-goto-ml=).  Its unofficial-official home is [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/org-search-goto-ml.el][on EmacsWiki]], but I've mirrored it [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-search-goto][on GitHub]]. It's a really great package, and the only thing that could make it better is to make it work with Helm.  To avoid confusion, this package has a completely different name.
+ Thanks to Thierry Volpiatto for doing such an amazing job with Helm.  Without him, this would not be possible. 

* Development

I can't recommend [[https://github.com/tj64/outorg][Outorg]] enough.  If you edit source code and use Emacs, check it out!

** Bugs

*** TODO Initially duplicated results

The major bug now is that immediately after typing, results in the Helm buffer are duplicated several times over, which is very strange.  But after inserting a trailing space, they disappear.  And after removing the trailing space, the duplicates do not return.  I'm not sure if it's a bug in this package or in Helm.  It might have something to do with the way we're using multiple sources, one-per-buffer.

However, I'm sure it can be fixed somehow.  And in the meantime, this is still very useful.

** Ideas

*** TODO Add key map

Using a custom key map will allow binding =helm-org-rifle-show-in-indirect-buffer= to a key.

*** TODO Collapse overlapping context strings

Right now, if more than one term appears in the same range, parts of that range will show up more than once in the context.  Not a big deal, but should be fixable.

*** TODO Further profiling

=helm-org-rifle-get-candidates-in-buffer= can probably be optimized more with =elp=.  This might also help with figuring out the duplicate-candidates bug.

*** TODO Match limit

=org-search-goto= had a match limit.  I removed it to simplify things, but it might still be useful, depending on how big one's org files are.

*** MAYBE Optionally include TODO keyword and/or tags

It could be handy to be able to match against the TODO keyword and tags.  Would make it more complicated, but probably not too hard, and maybe worth it.

*** MAYBE Negation

It would be handy to be able to use Helm-style =!word= negation patterns.
